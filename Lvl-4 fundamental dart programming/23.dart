//Difference between inheritance and encapsulation. B5. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.
// Ans.In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and methods
// from an existing class (base class), promoting code reuse and organization, while encapsulation bundles data and methods
//that operate on that data within a single unit (class), restricting direct access to the internal state and promoting data
//protection.

//B5. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.
// Ans.Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) can inherit properties and methods from an existing class
//(superclass), promoting code reusability. Abstraction, on the other hand, focuses on hiding implementation details and
//presenting only essential functionalities, simplifying complex systems.
