//Difference between inheritance and polymorphism
// Ans.Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass),
//promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchy. Polymorphism, on the other hand, enables objects of different
//classes to be treated as objects of a common type, allowing for flexibility and different behaviors based on the
//specific object type.
