//Difference between object oriented and object based language.
//Ans.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
//Core Principles: OOP languages are built around the concept of "objects," which are self-contained units of data and methods
//(functions) that operate on that data.
//Key Features:
//Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods into a single unit (class or object).
//Inheritance: Allowing one class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass).
//Polymorphism: Enabling objects of different classes to respond differently to the same method call.
//Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information.
//Examples: Java, C++, C#, Python.

//Object-Based Programming:
//Focus:
//Object-based languages provide the ability to create and use objects, but they may not fully support the core OOP principles
//of inheritance and/or polymorphism.
//Features:

//Encapsulation: Object-based languages typically support encapsulation, allowing you to bundle data and methods into objects.
//Limited Inheritance/Polymorphism: Some object-based languages might have limited or no support for inheritance or polymorphism.

//Examples:
//Early versions of Ada, Visual Basic 6 (VB6), and Fortran 90. JavaScript is sometimes considered object-based due to its
//prototype-based inheritance model, where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects rather than classes.
