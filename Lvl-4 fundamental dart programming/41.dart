//What happens when a class implements two interfaces and bothdeclare field (variable) with same name?
//Ans.When a class implements two interfaces that both declare fields (variables) with the same name,
//the class needs to explicitly resolve the ambiguity by either:
//1) using the interfaceName.fieldName syntax to access the field, or
//2) overriding the field with a new implementation in the class itself.
