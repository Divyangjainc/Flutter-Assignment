//How do you prevent overriding a Dart method without using the final modifier
//Ans.By using a private access modifier in the overriding method: A method's 
//visibility is restricted to the class in which it is defined when it is 
//declared private. Subclasses cannot access private methods, hence they cannot 
//be overridden
